  title: Shortcts
  description: This site was originally built in 24 hours by myself and three friends (Jon Buda, Matt Puchlerz and Mike Laurence) from November 7th-8th as a Hackathon submission at Social Dev Camp, Chicago. The idea for it came when Jon went searching for a hotkey he couldn't remember. The sites he came across were infested with Google Ads everywhere, and the content was buried deep within completely unusuable pages. Shortcts.in attempts to solve that problem by focusing solely on the experience. It's still a work-in-progress, and remains the most fun product I've worked on to-date.

  description: The open source "TinyButStrong":http://tinybutstrong.com project is quite lacking in a strong unifying design element. I felt in order to be more effective in it's adoption, new users need to see a coherent look that was fresh, sleek, and encompassed all that TBS is.

  description: Jumping on the <a href="http://refreshingcities.org">Refreshing Cities</a> bandwagon, I picked up the domain of my locale and threw up a temporary page. The idea behind this site is promotion of design, technology, usability, and standards. More is to come as time allows.

  description: This was a pro bono project for a church in order to get them a presence on the Internet. The pastor can post messages and add upcoming events through WordPress and Google Calendar respectively. This was one of the first sites that I created attempting to use web standards.
