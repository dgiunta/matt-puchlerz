      Biography
  :textile
    Hello, my name is *Matt*. I live just outside of Chicago, and work remotely as a _user interface developer_ for "Datatel (Software and services for higher education)":http://www.datatel.com. I'm an advocate of _web standards_ and prefer to use _Ruby frameworks_ for website build-out.

    A few friends and I are working on "Refresh Chicago (Promoting design, technology, usability, and standards)":http://refreshchi.org, a meetup group for the advancement of the city's designers and developers. With any luck, I will set aside time to paint again--maybe even go fly-fishing.
